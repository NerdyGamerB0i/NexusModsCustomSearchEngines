# NexusModsCustomSearchEngines
Handy Chromium browser search URLs for games on [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/)!

This project was borne out of convenience. I found myself installing dozens of Skyrim mods whenever I had a few minutes of free time. I also love keyboard shortcuts. I thought it would be nice if those mods were only a few keyboard strokes away. I figured it would be simple to throw together a custom search engine in my web browser for Nexus Mods. I was wrong. Nexus Mods and Chromium browsers don't do the best job at displaying the search query to the user, and instead displays something like 'https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/search/'

I figured since I was already digging through dev tools to get the exact search query for Skyrim SE, why not put *all* of the search URLs together in one place for *anyone* to use? That is the purpose of this project. If you are knee deep in modding a specific game, this repo should help make it trivial to add a custom search engine for all of that game's mods available on [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/).

If you have no idea what any of this means, the following will function as a tutorial to add a custom search engine to your Chromium based web browser.
